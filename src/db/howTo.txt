// Migrations (changes to the database)

You can generate migrations using drizzle-kit generate command and then run them using the drizzle-kit migrate command.

These migrations are stored in the drizzle/migrations directory, as specified in your drizzle.config.ts. This directory will contain the SQL files necessary to update your database schema and a meta folder for storing snapshots of the schema at different migration stages.

Run migrations:

npx drizzle-kit migrate
Alternatively, you can push changes directly to the database using Drizzle kit push command:

npx drizzle-kit push
